# sonus
A collection of various Max/MSP objects for creative patching coded in C++. This package was born as a collection of some custom externals
I made for different projects, so they are not really linked by a common thread. They anyway more or less deal with math,
artificial intelligence and weird sounds.

Currently finished externals are:

### Generators
* `sonus.bytebeat~` A bytebeat parser and generator
* `sonus.byteplay~` An efficient player of many bytebeat formulas
* `sonus.ecaosc~` Elementary cellular automata oscillator
* `sonus.harmosc~` Harmonic additive oscillator
* `sonus.lorenz~` Lorenz attractor based generator
* `sonus.neurosc~` Neural network based oscillator
* `sonus.nwosc~` User defined wavetable oscillator
* `sonus.nowave~` Scrambled wavetable oscillator
* `sonus.pdosc~` Phase distorted oscillator
* `sonus.pulsar~` Pulsar oscillator
* `sonus.roessler~` RÃ¶ssler attractor based generator
* `sonus.rsosc~` Oscillator with random shapes
* `sonus.vaosc~` Multishape bandlimited oscillator
* `sonus.window~` Window functions generator

### Effects and Sample Manipulation
* `sonus.bitinv~` Bitcrusher and bit inverter
* `sonus.bitman~` Bit manipulator
* `sonus.biquads~` Parallel biquad filters
* `sonus.buffx` Apply effects to buffers
* `sonus.bufsnap` Save snapshots of a buffer
* `sonus.cheby~` Chebyshev waveshaper
* `sonus.crossloop~` Buffer loop player with crossfade
* `sonus.cryptoverb~` Eerie stereo reverberator
* `sonus.fselector~` Continuous selector/mixer
* `sonus.quadpan~` Quadraphonic panner
* `sonus.summer~` Simple signal mixer
* `sonus.wavesets` Wavesets based sample manipulation

### Neural Networks and AI
* `sonus.acti` Activation functions
* `sonus.acti~` Activation functions (signal rate)
* `sonus.ca` Cellular automata system

* `sonus.ga` Genetic algorithm implementation
* `sonus.ga.num` Genetic algorithm implementation (numbers version)
* `sonus.linden` Lindenmayer generative system
* `sonus.neuron` Artificial neuron implementation
* `sonus.perceptron~` Classic perceptron implementation

### Math and Utilities
* `sonus.blist` Output different items from a list
* `sonus.bozo` Output a 1 and then a 0 when a bang is received
* `sonus.edist` Euclidean distance between two points
* `sonus.ftomel` Frequency to mel converter
* `sonus.hop` Hot inlets operations
* `sonus.lline` Similar to line, but for list of numbers
* `sonus.lrandom` Random items from a list
* `sonus.lurn` Non repeating random sequences
* `sonus.mathc` Mathematical constants
* `sonus.mbox` Pop up dialogs generator
* `sonus.meltof` Mel to frequency converter
* `sonus.mima~` Signal extremes analyzer
* `sonus.multirandom` Multi-outlet version of random object
* `sonus.mumul` Multiply numbers for the same factor
* `sonus.mumul~` Multiply signals for the same factor
* `sonus.quadpanner` Quadraphonic panner coefficients
* `sonus.summer` Numbers summator
* `sonus.tent` Tent map calculator
* `sonus.wtp` "The Well-Tuned Piano" tuner

The collection also features six Max for Live devices that use some sonus externals to create synths, effects and modulators.

## Compiled binaries

Compiled binaries for both Windows and macOS can be found in the [Releases section](https://github.com/valeriorlandini/sonus/releases). Please note that some of the listed externals may not yet be available in the latest compiled version.

## How to build

Grab the source inside your `Documents/Max 8/Packages` folder with `git clone https://github.com/valeriorlandini/sonus.git --recursive` 

`cd sonus` and then `mkdir build` to create a folder with your various build files.

`cd build` to put yourself into that folder.

### Mac 

Run `cmake -G Xcode ..`

Next run `cmake --build . --config Release` or open the Xcode project from this "build" folder and use the GUI.

Note: you can add the `-j4` option where "4" is the number of cores to use. This can help speed up your builds, though it may sometimes interleave the error output, making troubleshooting more challenging.

If you are running on a Mac M1 machine, you will likely see an error `cannot be loaded due to system security policy` when loading your externals in Max. To resolve this, you can ad-hoc codesign your external with `codesign --force --deep -s - myobject.mxo`.

### Windows

You can run `cmake --help` to get a list of the options available. 

Visual Studio 2022:

`cmake -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" ..`

Visual Studio 2019:

`cmake -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" ..`

Visual Studio 2017:

`cmake -G "Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64" ..`

Having generated the projects, you can now build by opening the .sln file in the build folder with the Visual Studio app (just double-click the .sln file) or you can build on the command line like this:

`cmake --build . --config Release`

Note: you can add the `-j4` option where "4" is the number of cores to use. This can help speed up your builds, though it may sometimes interleave the error output, making troubleshooting more challenging.
